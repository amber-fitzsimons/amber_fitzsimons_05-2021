### Communication

Dear (Client Name),

I am one of the developers from (Company Name) working on your marketing site project. Normally we liaise with your project manager, however she is out of town and we need some photos and content for the “About Us” page in order to meet the completion deadline.

Per previous discussion with your project manager, we need photos of the leadership team as well as a group photo of the entire staff.  We also need a couple of paragraphs describing the company and it’s mission statement. 

Once we receive the requested content, we will be able to finish up the project by the projected deadline. I look forward to seeing this go live!

Best regards,

Amber FitzSimons

### Code Test

Any details you'd like to mention about your code test.

The test was definitely challenging, I learned a lot while working on it. I know the JavaScript to merge the list of names and remove duplicates is right because I ran it in repl.it, but so far I haven't been able to make it work as requested in the html. I will continue to work on it, though!
